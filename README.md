# Project Overview

A feedreader testing project using Jasmine in a browser.

##Goals

Writing tests using Jasmine in the feedreader.js file on an application. Also be able to manipulate the DOM. The tests included were defining URL's and feed names,
hiding the test when the page is loaded and a few others to be found in the feedreader.js file.

## Viewing the Project
Download the ZIP file. Once downloaded, open the index.html file in a browser, preferably Chrome. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see Jasmine load the specs
and should show 0 failures
